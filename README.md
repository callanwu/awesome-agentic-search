# 🔍 Awesome Agentic Search

🤖 Agentic search refers to an advanced AI approach where autonomous agents plan and execute multi-step search processes to address complex queries. Unlike traditional search methods that provide static results, agentic search involves dynamic workflows where the AI agent decomposes a query, conducts iterative searches, evaluates information relevance, and synthesizes findings into coherent responses. This methodology enhances deep research capabilities, supports search-enhanced reasoning, and enables interleaved workflows, positioning AI agents as active researchers rather than passive information retrievers.

## 📊 Evaluation

We maintain a comprehensive evaluation table comparing different agentic search methods across key metrics like search efficiency, result quality, and reasoning capabilities. The table will be regularly updated as new methods and benchmarks emerge to help researchers track progress in the field.

## 🏆 Arena
We are building an arena page to benchmark different agentic search methods using standardized retrieval and web browser interfaces. This will enable fair comparisons between various approaches and help advance the state-of-the-art in agentic search.
